# Himanshu's Python Toolkit

Welcome to my personal collection of Python tools and projects. This repository serves as a dynamic showcase of various scripts and applications I've developed. My vision is for this to be an ever-growing toolkit that spans multiple domains, from cybersecurity to machine learning and beyond.

## About This Repository

This is a multi-project repository, designed to house a diverse range of standalone Python tools. The goal is to explore different facets of programming and problem-solving with Python. Each project is organized into a specific category, making it easy to navigate and explore.

The primary categories you'll find here include:

* **Cyber Tools**: Scripts and applications focused on security, encryption, and network analysis.
* **Mathematical Tools**: Utilities for performing complex calculations, data analysis, or mathematical simulations.
* **Machine Learning**: Implementations of ML models, data processing scripts, and experiments.
* **Core Python Tools**: General-purpose utilities, automation scripts, and demonstrations of core Python concepts.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized hierarchically to keep projects distinct and easy to navigate. The structure is as follows:

* **`Repository_Root/`**
    * This is the top-level directory.
    * It contains the main `README.md` file (the document you are currently reading).
    * It also contains the primary category folders.

* **`Category_Name/`**
    * Each folder at this level represents a broad category of tools (e.g., `Cyber_Tools`, `Machine_Learning`, `Data_Analysis`).
    * These folders act as containers for individual project directories.

* **`Project_Name/`**
    * Each project is housed in its own self-contained directory within a category folder.
    * This ensures that project files, dependencies, and documentation do not conflict with one another.

* **Inside each `Project_Name/` folder:**
    * **Source Code:** Contains all the necessary Python scripts (`.py`) and related files for the tool to function.
    * **`README.md`:** A dedicated, project-specific README file is included. This file provides detailed information on what the tool does, its features, and, most importantly, how to install and run it.
    * **`requirements.txt` (Optional):** If a specific tool depends on external Python libraries, this file will be present, listing all necessary dependencies for easy installation via `pip`.

## Vision and Future Goals

This repository is an active and ongoing endeavor. I will be adding new projects and refining existing ones over time. The aim is to build a robust and varied portfolio that demonstrates practical applications of Python in different fields.
